## Recommendations Algorithm

The system uses an updated sophisticated ranking algorithm:

```
Total Score = 0.4 × (Rating × Number of Reviews) + 0.3 × Image Penalty + 0.3 × (1 / Distance in km)
Where:

- Rating × Number of Reviews: Gives more weight to highly rated places with many reviews.
- Image Penalty: A penalty of 0.3 is applied if the place does not have images (Image Penalty = 1 if no images, otherwise 0).
- Distance Factor: Favors closer places using the inverse of the distance in km.
```
